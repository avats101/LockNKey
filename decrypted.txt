RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet. RSA is named for its inventors, Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard M. Adleman, who created it while on the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the RSA system, a user secretly chooses a pair of prime numbers p and q so large that factoring the product n = pq is well beyond projected computing capabilities for the lifetime of the ciphers. As of 2015, U.S. government security standards call for the modulus to be at least 2,048 bits in size—i.e., p and q each have to be about 308 decimal digits in size, so n is roughly a 617-digit number. Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.

RSA is named for its inventors, Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard M. Adleman, who created it while on the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the RSA system, a user secretly chooses a pair of prime numbers p and q so large that factoring the product n = pq is well beyond projected computing capabilities for the lifetime of the ciphers. As of 2015, U.S. government security standards call for the modulus to be at least 2,048 bits in size—i.e., p and q each have to be about 308 decimal digits in size, so n is roughly a 617-digit number.

As of 2015, U.S. government security standards call for the modulus to be at least 2,048 bits in size—i.e., p and q each have to be about 308 decimal digits in size, so n is roughly a 617-digit number. Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.

RSA is named for its inventors, Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard M. Adleman, who created it while on the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the RSA system, a user secretly chooses a pair of prime numbers p and q so large that factoring the product n = pq is well beyond projected computing capabilities for the lifetime of the ciphers. As of 2015, U.S. government security standards call for the modulus to be at least 2,048 bits in size—i.e., p and q each have to be about 308 decimal digits in size, so n is roughly a 617-digit number.

As of 2015, U.S. government security standards call for the modulus to be at least 2,048 bits in size—i.e., p and q each have to be about 308 decimal digits in size, so n is roughly a 617-digit number. Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.

Since the largest hard numbers that can currently be factored are only half this size and since the difficulty of factoring roughly doubles for each additional three digits in the modulus, 617-digit moduli are believed to be safe from factoring for several decades.RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet.
